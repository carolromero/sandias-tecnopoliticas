<p>We are a translocal group of collectives and individuals, activists, artists, researchers and designers, committed to resist the regime imposed by Big Tech, Big Oil and the computational financial industry, because their basis is complicit with and actively participates in the Zionist state of Israel and a world order that defines and maintains it.</p>

<p>Tecnosandías is an impulse of technopolitical solidarity with Palestine, which is expressed through a website and has the support of numerous local (=Bcn) and international projects and collectives. Tecnosandías promotes diverse initiatives, including its <a href="/statement.html">Statement</a>. Supporting one of them does not imply belonging to the network or supporting the rest of its activities.</p>
