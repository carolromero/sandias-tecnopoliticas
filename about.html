<p>Tecnosandías is a multilateral impulse of technopolitical solidarity with Palestine, expressed through this website and supported by numerous local and international projects and collectives. Its objective is to contribute to the anti-colonial cause of the Palestinian struggle for human rights (always in intersection with so many other struggles), intervening against the alliance between the Zionist State of Israel and the industrial-cultural complex of Big Tech. Tecnosandías boosts diverse initiatives, starting with its <a href="/statement.html">Statement</a>.</p> 

<p>Supporting one of our actions, campaigns or writings does not imply membership in the network or support for the rest of our activities.</p>
