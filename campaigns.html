<p>The upcoming MWC in Barcelona will feature exhibitions from multiple Israeli tech companies and the Israel Export &amp; International Cooperation Institute, an organization supported by the government of Israel and its Ministry of Industry.</p>

<p>Digital technology is playing a significant and dangerous role in the genocide against the Palestinian people. As the Israeli occupation advances and the siege on the Palestinian population intensifies, the network of technologies, companies, and businesses that favor and facilitate the massacre becomes increasingly evident.</p>

<p>Israel is using artificial intelligence technologies with the aim of carrying out indiscriminate attacks against the population and civilian homes and infrastructure to maximize human damage and destroy the fabric of life in Gaza. The use of Artificial Intelligence also seeks to mask the mass murder factory that the military operation on Gaza has become. The development of these tools also aims to try to evade International Humanitarian Law and signals an increase in the automation of mass killings in the future of armed conflicts.</p>

<p>Israel uses military force and technology to maintain its system of colonial occupation, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing and has based its economic growth on the technology of export. The Israeli technological conglomerate uses tools such as facial recognition, cyberespionage techniques, tracking and geolocation, and device intervention to persecute the entire Palestinian population. Amnesty International has determined how Israeli authorities extensively use these technologies to support the ongoing domination and oppression against the Palestinian population in the Occupied Territories.</p>

<p>The deep ties between Israel and major tech companies have allowed a bidirectional flow of benefits and complicity. On one hand, this allows Israel to deploy rapidly innovating technology developed by transnational companies and integrate it into its infrastructure of surveillance, control, and repression of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. On the other hand, Israeli technology developed to control the Palestinian people is made available to national and international tech companies to expand and export to other countries for repressive purposes. Israel uses Palestine, especially the Gaza Strip, as a testing ground to test new technologies, weapons, and methods of repression that are then exported to be used against civilians around the world. These products are advertised as "combat-proven" - that is, against the Palestinian civilian population - and this has become an added value in the international security and defense market.</p>

<p>Violations of international law, war crimes, and crimes against humanity committed by Israel during its frequent attacks on the Palestinian population are well-documented. Israel can only act with so much impunity because governments, companies, and research centers cooperate with its military and security industry and support it. International companies are complicit in the violations of international law committed by Israel, among other things by operating in illegal Israeli settlements and acting as contractors for the army and the state of Israel.</p>

<p>The participation of Israel and its tech companies at the MWC fair is a form of legitimization of crimes against humanity and genocide against the Palestinian people. The Geneva Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide obliges states to take measures to prevent any action that benefits the perpetuation of genocide practices.</p>

<p>Facilitating the business of Israeli tech companies that may benefit crimes against humanity and genocide is an act of complicity and goes against the principles of International Law. States and institutions have the obligation to take measures and not provide coverage for actions that may facilitate and benefit the genocide that Israel commits on the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>In 2022, GSMA banned the Pavilion and companies from Russia at the MWC following the request made by States and institutions in the face of the violation of International Law that the invasion of Ukraine </p>

<p>Barcelona should set an example and be a model of technological development respectful of Human Rights and International Law.</p>

<p>Mayor Jaume Collboni should request the withdrawal of Israeli institutions and companies from the MWC fair and not maintain or facilitate any kind of relationship with Israeli companies and institutions.</p>

<p>Enough complicity with genocide and apartheid. Enough complicity with Israel.</p>
